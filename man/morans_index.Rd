\title{Calculate spatial correlation of given municipalities in an incidence_rate
object.}
\usage{
morans_index(incidence_rate, threshold = 2, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence_rate}{Incidence rate object with only one observation for a
group of municipalities.}

\item{threshold}{Maximum traveling time around each municipality.}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, returns a plot of influential observations in the
Moran's plot.}
}
\value{
List of Moran's I clustering analysis, giving the quadrant of each
observation, influential values.
}
\description{
Function to calculate spatial autocorrelation via Moran's Index
from a given incidence_rate object grouped by municipality.
