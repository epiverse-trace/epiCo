**epiCo**'s *endemic channel* module is a tool to estimate a central tendency line, and an upper and lower limit for the expected number of cases of a disease, based on the historical data provided by the user and a set of customized parameters.

The `endemic_channel` function allows you to:

- Estimate a central tendency measure (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, or median)
- Estimate a confidence interval (based on the selected central tendency measure)
- Select the epidemic (outlier) years in your data and decide how to handle them
- Plot the estimated endemic channel with the parameters/assumptions displayed
- Plot the current (observed) cases to evaluate your epidemiological situation (ie. occurrance of an outbreak)

In the following vignette you will learn:

1. What is an endemic channel, its benefits, drawbacks, and cautions 
2. An example of the historical data needed to build an endemic channel
3. How to use the `endemic_channel` function
4. How to interpret and communicate the results

## 1. What is an endemic channel?

An endemic channel is a visual strategy to represent the historical behavior of a disease in an specific region on a epidemic curve that defines the central tendency of the cases during a year, and an upper and lower limits where cases are expected to vary. This plot provides four areas known as "$\color{green}{\text{Success}}$", "$\color{Gold}{\text{Safety}}$", "$\color{orange}{\text{Warning}}$", and "$\color{Red}{\text{Epidemic}}$" bands (Figure 1) which are later used to define the epidemiological situation of the region based on the the current (observed) cases.

The broader definition and methodology for the endemic channel was provided by [Bormant (1999)](https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/8562).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
# TODO: Fix figure path
knitr::include_graphics(path = "~/GitHub/epiCo/man/figures/endemic_channel_figure.png", error = FALSE)
```

The data needed to build an endemic channel is the weekly or monthly incidence of the disease for previous years in the region of interest. **epiCo** asks for at least one year of data but endemic channels are typically estimated from *5 to 7 years of information*.

It is natural to presume that more years provide better estimations, since the statistical analyses will be more robust, but it is important to have contextual information to asseverate that transmission, surveillance or demographic conditions (among other factors) have not change during this period of time. Regarding the frequency of the data, weekly incidence may provide more useful information about the disease behavior and the moment in which an epidemiological warning should be raised, however it is again up to the experience of the users and their context whether this resolution of data can be achieved.

Another common decision during the building of an endemic channel is to ignore previous epidemic years to avoid misrepresentation of the traditional transmission dynamics. **epiCo** does not suggest epidemic years automatically but its `endemic_channel` function does provide the option to annotate the outlier years and decide whether to include, ignore, or modify them. More data gathering tips and sources are provided later in this vignette.

### The central tendency measure (CTM)

To have a statistical summary of the disease behavior, the endemic channel provides a central tendency measure (CTM) that should describe the typical value of the historical data.

Since the nature of the epidemiological data tends no be not normal, the typically CTM used in the endemic channels is the *geometric mean*. This CTM is known to better represent the expected value of a data set with a skewed distribution and/or susceptible to outliers (previous outbreaks). The `endemic_channel` function uses the geometric mean as default CTM but arithmetic mean or median can be choose according to user's experience and context.

Is important to declare that as the geometric mean performs a multiplication of the data, when zero cases are reported in a moment of time the estimation leads to a zero CTM. To avoid this, **epiCo**'s `endemic_channel` function performs a shift on the data to sum up one case (default value) to all observations and then it subtracts this shift to the final calculation. To avoid random selection of the shift, users can ask `endemic_channel` function to find an optimal value based on 
[de la Cruz & Kreft, 2019](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1806.06403), or they can also ask to use a weighted method as described by [Habib, 2012](https://www.arpapress.com/volumes/vol11issue3/ijrras_11_3_08.pdf).

Finally, the `endemic_channel` function can perform a Poisson test (unusual behavior method) on the historical data if is requested by the user after taking into the account the pertinence of the test, since it is mostly used for scenarios or diseases with very low incidence records. This method uses the arithmetic mean as CTM.

### The upper and lower limits

The upper and lower limits of the endemic channel provide a confidence interval that are used to define the epidemiological bands previously described.

**epiCo**'s `endemic_channel` function have the following preset of limits according to the selected CTM:

- Arithmetic or Geometric mean as CTM: mean +/- *t* value for a 95% CI multiplied by variance of the data over the number of observations
- Median as CTM: quantiles 0.25 and 0.75 as lower and upper limits respectively
- Poisson test (Unusual behavior method): limits provided by a two sides Poisson test with 0.95% CI

## 2. Historical data needed to build an endemic channel

This section provides some strategies to obtain, handle and gather the historical data needed to build an endemic channel. It presumes that user have either the linelist or incidence data for the disease of interest, or the need to consult historical data from the Colombian National Surveillance System
[SIVIGILA](https://www.ins.gov.co/Direcciones/Vigilancia/Paginas/SIVIGILA.aspx).

Regardless the user´s case, the goal of this section is to create an `incidence` object with the historical data of the disease.This object must account for the incidence of a single region (no groups are allowed in the `endemic_channel` function), it must have a weekly or monthly interval (epiweeks are also allowed), and it must represent at least one year or information. 

To have a broader understanding of the `incidence` package please refer to its [vignettes](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/).

### Historic incidence from linelist or SIVIGILA data

The endemic channel is more useful when data up to the immediate previous year is available, however this is not always possible for users out of the surveillance institutions. As an option, users can access to SIVIGILA's linelist data that is typically published until the second semester of the year (ie. data for 2022 was published in the second semester of 2023).

<!-- To have a broader understanding on SIVIGILA data manipulation please refer to [`sivirep`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/sivirep/) vignettes. In future versions an **automatic endemic channel** function may be released in this package, performing the following data handling: -->

For this example, the data provided in the data folder of the package will be used. These data present the data for dengue cases for all municipalities in Tolima for the years 2015 to 2021. In this case, we will use the cases from the municipality of Ibagué to calculate the respective endemic channel.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}

data("epi_data")
data_event <- epi_data

data_ibague <- data_tolima[data_tolima$cod_mun_o == 73001,]

## Building the historic incidence data

incidence_historic <- incidence::incidence(data_ibague$fec_not,
  interval = "1 epiweek"
)

print(incidence_historic)
```

When users have their own linelist data the goal is the same: to clean and handle the data to build the `incidence` object (named `incidence_historic` in the previous example). The key message is that a list of dates that account for the event of interest is needed to later be used in the [`incidence`](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) package.

### Setting up the data from incidence information

Future versions of **epiCo**'s `endemic_channel` function will allow the users to import a table accounting for periods of time (weeks or months) and count of cases, so when they do not have specific information on the dates for each case and endemic channel can still be builded.

## 3. Using **epiCo**'s `endemic_channel` function

After gathering the incidence data, users are ready to ask **epiCo** to build an *endemic channel*.

The `endemic_channel` function has the following parameters:

- `incidence_historic`: An incidence object with the cases counts of the previous years
- `observations`: A numeric vector with the current observations *(default = NULL)*
- `method`: A string with the mean calculation method of preference ("median", "mean", or "geometric") or "unusual_behavior" method (Poisson Distribution Test) *(default = "geometric")*
- `geom_method`: A string with the selected method for geometric mean calculation (see epiCo's geom_mean function) *(default = "shifted")*
- `outlier_years`: A numeric vector with the outlier (epidemic) years *(default = NULL)*
- `outliers_handling`: A string with the handling decision regarding outlier years:

    - ignored = data from outlier years will not take into account *(default)*
    - included = data from outlier years will take into account
    - replaced_by_median = data from outlier years will be replaced with the median and take into account
    - replaced_by_mean = data from outlier years will be replaced with the mean and take into account
    - replaced_by_geom_mean = data from outlier years will be replaced with the geometric mean and take into account
- `ci`: A numeric value to specify the confidence interval to use with the geometric method *(default = 0.95)*
- `plot`: A boolean for displaying a plot *(default = FALSE)*

The output of *epiCo*'s `endemic_channel` function is a dataframe with the observation, historical mean, and confidence intervals, and a plot displaying the four epidemiological bands, the current observations (if provided), and the methods and outliers handling set by the user.

### Example

The following example uses the previously historic incidence accessed from the SIVIGILA data source to build the 2023 *endemic channel* for Ibagué city.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(epiCo)

observations <- c(
  17, 23, 21, 11, 25, 24, 19, 17, 16, 11, 23, 20, 17, 24, 23, 33, 53, 55,
  44, 36, 34, 51, 41, 44, 27, 32, 53, 55, 55, 48, 64, 69, 73, 59, 74, 78, 75
)

outlier_years <- c(2016, 2019)

endemic_channel(
  incidence_historic = incidence_historic,
  observations = observations,
  outlier_years = outlier_years,
  plot = TRUE
)
```
