**epiCo**'s demographics module is a tool for demographic descriptive analysis and
risk assessment of epidemiological events in Colombia. Based on linelist data 
provided by the National Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) and demographic data
from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), the functions
displayed in this vignette will allow you to:

- Consult the population pyramid of a municipality, department, or the country
for a year of interest
- Calculate a relative age risk by normalizing the distribution of cases
by the specific age structure of the location of interest
