## Installation

You can install the development version of *epiCo* from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/epiCo")
```

## Example

These examples illustrate some of the current functionalities:

``` r
library(epiCo)
library(incidence)
library(qcc)

## Occupation labels

isco_codes <- c(7321, 2411, 4121, 3439, 3431)
isco_labels <- get_occupationLabels(isco_codes, output_level = "unit_label")

## Incidence rates estimation

data("dengue_orinoquia_2017")
incidence_object <- incidence(dengue_orinoquia_2017$FEC_NOT, groups = dengue_orinoquia_2017$COD_MUN_O, interval = "1 week")
incidenceRate_object <- estimate_incidenceRate(incidence_object, level = 2)

## Outbreaks detection

# EWMA method

incidence_arauca <- incidence_object$counts[,"81001"]
outbreaks_object <- detect_outbreaks_EWMA(incidence_arauca, lambda = 0.2, nsigmas = 2)

```

## Development

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that
essential features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the
package is not ready for use outside of the development team.
